The files in this directory are generated using the loan application recording (Call6_mono_16k_az_apply_loan.wav, from within the demo_app files), and run through the demo tool within Azure AI Speech Studio (<https://speech.microsoft.com/portal>).

These transcriptions were created with all possible options enabled (e.g. diarization, lower-level timestamps, language detection on), and may include more data and fields than a simpler transcription request. This means that code used to process transcription files should always handle when fields may be missing.
